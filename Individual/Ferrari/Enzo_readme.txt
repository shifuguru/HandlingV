# Realistic Handling for the Ferrari Enzo.


## About the Ferrari Enzo:
The Ferrari Enzo (Type F140) is a mid-engine sports car manufactured by Ferrari and named after the company's founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was developed in 2002 using Formula One technology, such as a carbon-fibre body, F1-style automated-shift manual transmission, and carbon fibre-reinforced silicon carbide ceramic composite disc brakes, as well as active aerodynamics. The Enzo generates substantial amounts of downforce through its front underbody flaps, small adjustable rear spoiler and rear diffuser.
